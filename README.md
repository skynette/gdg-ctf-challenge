## Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenge Instructions

### How to Participate
1. Navigate through our website and explore its various sections.
2. Keep an eye out for clues, anomalies, or anything that seems out of the ordinary.
3. Once you've discovered a hidden flag, take note of it. Flags may appear as strings, codes, or unique identifiers (e.g., secret_code_fl4g).
4. Head over to the CTF Submission page.
5. Choose a unique username for this challenge; this will be how you are identified on the leaderboard.
6. Submit the discovered flag along with your chosen username.

### Scoring
- Each flag you submit has an associated score based on its difficulty. The more challenging the flag, the higher the score.
- Your total score will reflect the cumulative points earned from successfully identifying and submitting hidden flags.
- If a user submits a flag that has already been submitted by others, the score for that flag will be divided by the number of other people who have already submitted it. This means that the score will be adjusted based on the level of difficulty and the number of successful submissions, encouraging participants to focus on unique, hidden, and challenging flags.
