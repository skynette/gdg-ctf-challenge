							Challenge Description:
						</h3>
						<p>
							Hidden within the depths of our website lies a series of
							intriguing challenges for you to conquer. Your mission, should you
							choose to accept it, is to discover the hidden flags scattered
							across our pages. These flags are cleverly concealed, so sharpen
							your detective skills and embark on this digital adventure.
						</p>

					<div className="text-left mb-6">
						<h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">How to Participate:</h3>
						<ol className="list-decimal pl-6">
							<li>
								Navigate through our website and explore its various sections.
							</li>
							<li>
								Keep an eye out for clues, anomalies, or anything that seems out
								of the ordinary.
							</li>
							<li>
								Once you've discovered a hidden flag, take note of it. Flags may
								appear as strings, codes, or unique identifiers (e.g.,
								secret_code_fl4g).
							</li>
							<li>Head over to the <Link to="/ctf" className="text-clr-gdg-green">CTF Submission page</Link>.</li>
							<li>
								Choose a unique username for this <span className="text-xs">{flags.hard_fl4g}</span> challenge; this will be how
								you are identified on the leaderboard.
							</li>
							<li>
								Submit the discovered flag along with your chosen username.
							</li>
						</ol>

					<div className="text-left mb-6">
						<h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Scoring:</h3>
						<p>
							Each {flags.whisper_fl4g} you submit has an associated score based on its
							difficulty. The more challenging the flag, the higher the score.
							Your total score will reflect the cumulative points earned from
							successfully identifying and submitting {flags.hidden_fl4g}.
						</p>
						<p>
							If a user submits a flag that has already been submitted by others,
							the score for that flag will be divided by the number of other people
							who have already submitted it. This means that the score will be
							adjusted based on the level of difficulty and the number of successful
							submissions, encouraging participants to focus on unique, {flags.hidden_fl4g}, and challenging flags.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div className="text-left mb-6">
						<h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Leaderboard:</h3>
						<p>
							Curious about how you stack up against other participants? Check
							out the Leaderboard page to see who's leading the pack. Your
							username and score will be displayed for bragging rights and
							recognition.
						</p>
						<p>You'd be surprised how many links are embedded with flags in or what you can click to reveal them :) </p>
						<p>Here is a bonus one to get started <span className="text-clr-gdg-green">{flags.easy_fl4g}</span></p>
